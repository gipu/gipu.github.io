of Calcutta has a glorious past. Of its many departments, Department of Geology, 
claims a front-rank with an enviable share of the glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Founded on July 17, 1892,
it is the earliest independent department of teaching and learning geology in any 
educational institution in India with only the Madras Presidency
College teaching geology earlier, albeit as a part of its
courses of the Botany Department. </font>

<p align="justify"><font face="Souvenir Lt BT" size="4" color="#0000FF">The more than hundred years of history has
lots to hold high to the world. The Department has a long tradition of teaching
and research in geology, not merely as a professional means, but, and more so,
as a science, that could imbue students with reasoning, insight and audacity to
face the task of truthfully exploring the earth in its right perspectives. The
grooming produced not just a major bulk, but even the most of the brightest professionals
and academicians of the country.

 It has a long list of <i>Architects</i>,
teachers or non-teachers, whose missionary zeal helped <i>Buds</i>
to bloom. It set up a <i>Geological Institute</i>, a student-run academic
organization, unique of its kind in at least Asia, to
foster extra-academic acumen among the students by way of
organizing seminars, meetings, tours and publications etc. The publication, <i>Bhu
Vidya</i>, a bilingual annual intended to help students venture – think and
express—beyond their class- room learning
, on the very strength of the latter itself. The history long demanded
documentation. </font>
