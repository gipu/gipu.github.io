							<h2>'Mars For Earthlings: Using Earth Analogues To Decode The Sedimentary
History Of Mars' by Prof. Marjorie Chan</h2>
							<p>On 18th February,2014 the Institute organised a lecture by one of the
most distinguished professor of recent time in the field of geophysics
and geology, Prof. Marjorie Chan of Utah University.She and her STAR
group, ie, sedimentary and terrestrial analog research group works on
a large range of projects covering sedimentology, stratigraphy and
diagenesis. The lecture was mostly based on how one can use
sedimentary features,found on earth,to interpret or rather deduce a
possible sedimentary history of planet mars. This talk explored Earth
analog comparisons to Mars that included: red rocks and concretions
("blueberries") and the implications for past fluid flow, similarities
of cross bedded sandstone, comparisons of shoreline geometries, and
weathering.</p>

							<h2>'Radioactivity & The Early Earth' by Mr. David R. Nelson</h2>
							<p>PA lecture by Mr. David R. Nelson was organised on the aforesaid topic
by the Geological Institute on 31st July,2013.Uranium, thorium and
potassium are the main elements contributing to natural terrestrial
radioactivity. The isotopes 228U, 235U, 232Th and 40K decay with
half-lives so long that significant amounts remain in the earth,
providing a continuing source of heat. The slow decay of these
isotopes also provides the basis for radiometric age dating and
isotopic modelling of the evolution of the earth and its crust. There
is a complex interplay between their heat production and the processes
involved in crust formation. Phenomena such as volcanism, earthquakes,
and large-scale hydrothermal activity associated with ore deposition
reflect the dissipation of heat energy from the earth, much of which
is derived from natural radioactivity.</p>

							<h2>'The Great Oxidation Event & Emerging Aerobiosis-What Can Molecular
Fossils Tell Us?' by Dr.Christian Hallmann</h2>
							<p>On 10th May,2013 the Institute organised yet another lecture. This
time it was by Dr.Christian Hallmann from the Max Planck Institute for
Biogeochemistry, Jena, Germany.The late Archean and Paleoproterozoic
sedimentary sequence records (most likely) the biological invention of
oxygenic photosynthesis and the initial rise of oxygen in Earth's
atmosphere, termed the Great Oxidation Event.  Dr. Hallmann and his
research group studies the co-evolution of life and environmental
conditions on the early Earth by analyzing the sedimentary
hydrocarbons remnants of biological lipids. The distribution and
stable isotopic composition of such molecules in Precambrian rocks
carry clues to organismic diversity, metabolism and depositional redox
conditions. The lecture was based on these recent finding of Dr.
Hallmann and his team.</p>

							<h2>'Deformation Features Of Asian Continent Due To the Collision Of
India' by Prof. Y. Otofuji </h2>
							<p>On 4th March, 2013 the Geological Institute, Presidency University
organised a lecture by distinguished professor Y. Otofuji of Kobe
University, Japan on the aforesaid topic. Prof. Otofuji's research
mainly concentrates on deformation of continent and  evolution of the
earth core. Studying the deformation features of continental blocks of
East Asia is one of the main objectives of his research. Collision of
India and Asia is one of the most prominent tectonic events in
Cenozoic time. The Indian continent collided to Asia at about 52 Ma
and continued to penetrate into the Asian continent. The northward
penetration of India gave rise to tectonic deformation in the Asian
continent.  The lecture focused on the deformation features within the
southern part of the Asian continent due to this collision of India.</p>
